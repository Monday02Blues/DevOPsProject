# Image Search Application with DevOps Integration

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack Image Search Application designed to demonstrate both modern web development and practical DevOps practices. Users can search for images using keywords, and the application fetches relevant image results using an external API such as Unsplash.

The application is supported by a complete DevOps pipeline, incorporating version control, containerization, automated builds, and continuous deployment using GitHub Actions. It is ideal for students, developers, and DevOps learners who want to implement a real-world end-to-end project.

## Features

- Keyword-based image search functionality
- Clean and responsive user interface
- API-based image retrieval (e.g., Unsplash API)
- Dockerized frontend and backend components
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Auto-deployment to GitHub Pages or a cloud service (Render/Heroku)
- Optional: Extendable to include image upload and ML-based image tagging

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript or React.js

### Backend:
- Node.js with Express, or Python Flask
- External API: Unsplash, Bing Image Search API, or custom database

### DevOps:
- Git & GitHub for version control
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Pages, Render, or Heroku for deployment

## CI/CD Workflow

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Triggers on every push to the main branch
- Builds the frontend/backend
- Optionally runs tests
- Deploys automatically to the hosting platform
